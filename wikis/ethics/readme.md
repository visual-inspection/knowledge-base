# Visual Inspection: Ethics

In this document, we outline the ethical standards that are applied within this project.


# Authorship and Contributionship

We adhere to the CORE[^1] guidelines for authorship and contributionship.
We agree to the following specifically:

* All authors listed on a manuscript should have contributed significantly to the paper (e.g. experimental design, its implementation, or analysis and interpretation of the data).
* A contributor **must not** be included because of, e.g., their reputation, position of authority, or friendship (“guest authorship”).
* All authors should have been involved **in the writing of the manuscript** at draft and any revision stages, **and** have read and approved the final version.
* Anyone who made major contributions to the writing of the manuscript should be listed as an author.
* Any other individuals who made less substantive contributions to the writing of the manuscript (or to the performed experiment) **should be listed in the acknowledgement section instead**.
* For example, performing technical services, translating text, identifying patients for study, supplying materials, and providing funding or administrative oversight over facilities where the work was done **are not, in themselves, sufficient for authorship**, although these contributions may be acknowledged in the manuscript.
* Any change in authorship (including author order) after the initial manuscript submission must be approved in writing by all authors.
