# Wikis

Here, we gather Wikis and Wiki-like knowledge base articles.
Each article is supposed to be self-contained.
However, we share a list of [Bibtex references](./references.bib).

A Wiki may consist of more than one page.
If so, then its `readme.md` should provide some kind of directory listing.
If the Wiki is a single-page Wiki, then all of its content should be in the `readme.md` instead.
